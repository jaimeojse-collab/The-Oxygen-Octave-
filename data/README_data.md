# Data sources

This folder contains the reference frequencies and derived ratios used in *The Oxygen Octave – v1.6.1*.

| Molecule | Mode | Frequency (cm⁻¹) | Source |
|-----------|------|------------------|---------|
| O₂ | Fundamental ν | 1580.19 | NIST |
| O₃ | 2ν₃ overtone | 2084.0 | HITRAN 2023 |
| H₂O | Symmetric stretch ν₁ | 3657.0 | NIST 2022 |
| O₂⁻ | Vibrational doublet (est.) | 2200.0 | DFT / anion band (Appendix A) |

All ratios are normalized to O₂ (1580.19 cm⁻¹) and folded within the 1–2 octave range.
Tolerance: ±2 % (~±34 cents). See *Table 3.5* of the main document for detailed derivations.
