# The Oxygen Octave  
A structural vibrational hypothesis on oxygen coherence across scales  

## Abstract  
Oxygen is not only essential for life but may represent a universal coherence anchor. Analysis of public NIST vibrational datasets shows that oxygen-related molecules, radicals, and isotopes all align with harmonic fractions of the O₂ baseline stretch (1580 cm⁻¹), with <12% drift. This defines a coherence budget: <5% = stable regime, 7–12% = torsional threshold, >12% = collapse.  

The invariance of this budget across reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), biomolecules, halogen/sulfate salts, isotopes, planetary atmospheres, and even rocket-fuel intermediates suggests a structural law rather than coincidence.  

## Atomic Foundation  
The atomic foundation of this universality lies in oxygen’s 2p⁴ configuration, yielding a stable ³P triplet ground state. Unlike its neighbors (C: unstable ³P diradical; N: ⁴S quartet; F: ²P doublet), oxygen uniquely combines triplet stability with dual divisibility—by electron pairing (½) and orbital thirds (⅓). This dual symmetry explains why oxygen alone supports coherence across vibrational, isotopic, and electronic domains, extending even to excited UV/IR states (<1% drift).  

## Hypothesis  
We propose that oxygen’s coherence budget functions as a universal harmonic law governing molecular stability, energy transfer, and atmospheric processes. This framework is directly falsifiable: any vibrational dataset showing random distribution or systematic deviation >12% across domains would refute the model.  

If confirmed, it suggests oxygen acts as a structural invariant transcending physics, chemistry, and biology. Applications extend to bioenergetics, aerospace (ISRU oxygen, rocket propellants), and quantum-inspired computing.
